# About
This python script program is used to reemplace my Excel Spreadsheets that I have myself created and used for a long time for the track of study hours, academic grades, and other data, that was connected to the output .CSV file of [Abstract's spoon ToDoList](https://abstractspoon.com/).

It is intended also to be used for me as a Study project for learning DataAnalysis libraries for python.

# Capabilities
Some of the functions include:
- [X] Display total hours per Subject for each Semester

- [ ] Display daily study hours through the Semester, in comparison to previous academic Semesters
